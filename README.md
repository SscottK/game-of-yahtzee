## Rules

-Just some basics
-Each round a player gets 3 chances to roll the dice. When a player is rolling it is their turn
-At any point during a players turn they may choose to score their dice. See **"Ways to Score"** below to see how points are scored.
-If you can not score with the dice after 3 rolls you will have to choose one of the ways to score and "scratch" it.
-Once all boxes are filled, either with points or scratches, your game is over and you can not score anymore points.
-When the game is over the player with the highest score wins.

## Ways to score

-One way to score is to add together all dice that are matching numbers. For example if you have four 2's you can select the twos score box and you will score 8 points.
-Another way to score is to use one of the patterns. There are six different patterns scores.
    -Three and Four of a kind. If you have any 3 or 4 dice with matching numbers the points are the total of all dice added together.
    -Full House. If you have two matching dice and three matching dice at one time you score 25 points.
    -Small Straight. If you have four dice that are sequential then you can score 30 point.
    -Large Straight. If you hace five dice that are sequential then you can score 40 point.
    -Chance. The total of all dice added togethe.
    -Yahtzee. The namesake of the game and the highest points on the board. You must have ALL FIVE DICE matching in number and then you can score a Yahtzee.
